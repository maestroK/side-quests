# 🧭 side-quests

Random code dumps from late-night curiosity, vibe-driven experiments, or side explorations that didn’t fit into a full-blown project. Some might be useful, others are just brain dumps. No promises — just code.

## 📂 What's in here?

- 🧪 Experiments that went nowhere (yet)
- 🎯 Tiny utilities or scripts
- 🧠 ML/quantum/physics ideas that didn’t make the main repo
- 🐇 Rabbit holes I fell into

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Unpolished. Unfiltered. Possibly broken. Definitely fun.

**Not everything has to be a main quest.**
